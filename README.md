# PROJECT
 Aim:
The aim of the project is to this project is to attempt a solar panel positioning system which can change position(angle) dynamically to optimize it’s energy generation according to the sun’s position and intensity with respect to it and provide a live feedback to the user regarding it’s position.
The dynamic solar panel positioning system senses the sun’s position and intensity based on the feedback from it’s sensors. Based on the feedback it decides and calculates the angle of positioning of the solar panel and feeds it to the servo motors. The angles fed to the servo motors are complementary to with respect to one another since they are placed opposite to each other. The system is dynamic and changes position as soon as required since the looping period for the code is quick. The system provides a live feedback to the user with the help of an LCD.

Results: 
The circuit was first simulated on TinkerCAD using the listed components and secured the desired output. The circuit was implemented in hardware using a breadboard and the listed components, an (I2C Lcd couldn’t be sourced hence the output couldn’t be visualised on an LCD.) The required output was obtained successfully on the servo motors.
